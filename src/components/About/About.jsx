                        I'm Miraya. Design engineer in DÃ¼sseldorf, born in Sweden.

                        <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Here's what I actually do:</span> I take your broken interfaces and make them work. 
                        Not just "look pretty" - actually function at 60fps while being accessible to everyone.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Most designers can't code. Most developers can't design. I do both. While 
                        others debate aesthetics, I'm shipping pixel-perfect interfaces that perform. 
                        ARIA compliance isn't optional, it's standard.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I've built a 130K+ developer community on social media because I actually 
                        know what I'm talking about. My open-source projects prove it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The result? Interfaces that don't just impress your users - they convert them.
                    </p>

                            I also blog about design, development, and everything in between.

                        When I'm not coding, I'm at the gym or watching anime. Hot chocolate over 
                        coffee, always.
